# PlayRustClassifier

This is a system for classifying [Reddit](http://reddit.com)
posts on the [/r/rust subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/rust)
that were intended for the
[/r/playrust subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/playrust).

This repository is a modern (2021) approved fork of
/insanitybit/PlayRustClassifier. That codebase was written in
2016; this project aims to bring it up to date to run on
current Rust. All the good things here are from the original
authors. The bad things were introduced by me (@BartMassey).

This is very much a work-in-progress. Please consider contributing.
